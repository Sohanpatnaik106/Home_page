		<h1> Something about me... </h1>

		<section class = "myself">

			<p> <img src = "iitkgp.jpg" align = "right" width = "300px" hspace = "20"> This is Sohan Patnaik, native of Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. I'm quite privileged to be pursuing my first year undergraduate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I joined this premier institute with Mechanical as my core stream having immense fascination for exploring the infinity of computers. I endeavour to expand my knowledge in myriad areas including competitive programming, game developement, web developement, and the need of the hour i.e. machine learning. I aspire to build a career as a machine learning expert, to be specific, image processing.  </p>

			<p> That is the herald of the journey after I have got into IIT. Hope you will be interested to know the journey, yes, the so called strife to get into IIT.

		<section class = "school"> 
			<p> <img src = "dav.jpeg" align = "left" hspace = "20" width = "190px"> My school. Nah! My second home. I spent 14 years in D.A.V. Public School, Unit VIII, Bhubaneswar, starting from LKG to class XII. The journey was awesome and exciting too. I came across a lot of teachers who motivated me towards my goal and were quite supportive too. You know what, I came to know about intense competition in class IX when we had our sections changed, a section that had legends in my words. I struggled initially but could come out with flying colours eventually. </p>

		<section class = "parents">
			Well, that is all about my education. But I would never forget the efforts that my parents put in for me. They did everything that they could have done. They inculcated the fighting spirit in me which has made me stand where I am.
